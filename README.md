# Super TodoMVC

This is a demo project for [Webfoundry](https://webfoundry.app/), the visual app and site builder.

It's your typical [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) implementation with some extras: a stats and a chat tab.
In the stats tab you can see some statistics about your to-do's. In the chat tab you can chat with ChatGPT about them.

You can [try it live](https://super-todomvc.netlify.app/) or [import it into Webfoundry](https://www.webfoundry.app/editor.html?git=https://github.com/guiprav2/super-todomvc.git) for editing, customization, or inspection.
